# The two Cloud Run services the one image is deployed to. www.altshift.se is served by
# Firebase Hosting, which reaches a service over its run.app URL and cannot rewrite to
# europe-north2 -- so the europe-north1 service is the one visitors actually get, and the
# europe-north2 one behind the load balancer is what it is being moved off. Both answer for
# the name until DNS says otherwise, so both are deployed: pushing the image does not make
# Cloud Run take it, and deploying only the first leaves the public site on the old one.
